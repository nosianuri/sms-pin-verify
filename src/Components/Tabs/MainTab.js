        <ul className="ul-article">

            <li>Remain anonymous. A well-known fact: if you know the number, you can find out the data about its owner: surname, name, passport number, residential address. When using the SMS activation service, the information leakage is excluded.</li>
            <li>Protect yourself from fraudsters. You've probably been faced with the websites that ask you to enter a phone number to download a file without a speed limit. By entering your phone number on such sites, you risk to connect paid services and subscriptions. That’s why, we recommend to use a disposable temporary number.</li>
            <li>Get discounts by participating in activities. Various services and online stores conduct promotional activities, handing out gifts in exchange for phone numbers. In such cases, the rule "one gift to one hand" operates, that’s why it is required to enter a phone number and confirm by SMS.

            <li>Get rid of country restrictions. Some Internet projects don’t allow residents of specific states to get registered. The reasons may be different, for example, a Ukrainian site is often unavailable for a Russian user and vice versa. Sometimes a text message from a Belarusian operator may not reach to the recipient abroad. And then a temporary number to receive SMS will be handy on similar Internet resources.</li>
